# Fuck hope
 
I am an insane person who has been led to github by the voices in my head, almost like god led abraham somewhere, but i'm not atheist and coding seems like fun.
And I enjoy trying, and failing, to understand even the most basic things in this world of IT. Mostly Windows, since my computer is just fatally hacked. It's barely
my computer anymore. So I'm thinking I'm gonna try and learn to use the tool Visual Basic. Which is just a tool. tho, and not a a programming language, i think.
I'll go with one of the more popular ones, it'll be fine, i think.
PLEASE HELP!!!
